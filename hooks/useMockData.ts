// This hook is deprecated and has been intentionally left empty.
// It was part of an old mock data system and is no longer in use.
//
// Components should now fetch their own data directly from the API service
// located at 'src/services/mockApi.ts' using standard React hooks
// like useState and useEffect. This ensures data is always fresh and
// state is managed within the component that needs it.

export {}; // Exports nothing to prevent usage.
